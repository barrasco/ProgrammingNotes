2. ### The Sprint
* One Month or less to create consistency;
* Each Sprint may be considered a **small project**
* New Sprint starts immediately after conclusion of previous Sprints;
* All steps to achieve the Product Goal, including **Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective** happen within Sprints.
* Sprints enable predictability, by inspection and adaptation of progress for the Product Goal at least every month;
* Sprint may become **invalid** when horizon for the Sprint Goal is too long (complexity may rise or risk may increase);
* Shorter Sprints can be used to generate more learning cycles, with a smaller risk /cost / effort;
* A Sprint can be cancelled when its Goal becomes **Obsolete**. This is made by the Product Owner;
* During Sprint, 
  * No changes are made that can endanger the Sprint Goal;
  * Quality does no decrease;
  * Product backlog is refined as needed;
  * Scope can be re-negotiated with the Product Owner as required;
  
3. ### Sprint Planning 
  Timebox: max 8h for a Month Sprint, less for shorter Sprints)

  * Why is this Sprint valuable? `(Define Sprint Goal)`
  * What can be done in this Sprint? `(Select / Refine Backlog items, backtrack past performance)`
  * How will the chosen work get done? `(Break down Backlog items into small work items of one day or less, by developers)`

  > Sprint Backlog = The Sprint Goal + Selected Product Backlog Items + Plans to deliver them; 

4. ### Daily Scrum
  Timebox : 15 min daily for the Developers of Scrum Team
  * Inspect Sprint progress towards Sprint Goal and adjust the Backlog if necessary and upcoming work;
  * Produces actionable plan for the next day of work, creates focus and self-management, improves communications, promotes quick decision-making facing identified impediments;

5. ### Sprint Review
  Timebox: max 4h for 1 month Sprint
  * The goal is to inspect Sprint outcome and determine future adaptations;
  * Presentation of Sprint work to stakeholders and discussion of Product Goal progress. Review of what has changed in their environment. 
  * Based on the discussed information, attendees collaborate on future developments, and possible Product Backlog adjustments, facing new opportunities.

6. ### Sprint Retrospective
  Timebox : max 3h for 1 month Sprint
  * Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness;
  * Discuss what went well, what problems were encountered, and how they were (or weren't) resolved;
  * Inspection of the last Sprint for individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and definition of Done;
  * The most impactful improvements are addressed ASAP, that may even result in adding to the next Sprint backlog;

7. ### Scrum Artefacts
